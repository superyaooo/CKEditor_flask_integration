An example of CKEditor integration in flask apps with image upload functionality.
 
This is a simplified version of a more complicated example I found on the Internet.

I used secure_filename in this example.
I also added allowed_files function so that only images can be uploaded.
The image upload path is reset to static/img/upload in the code.
